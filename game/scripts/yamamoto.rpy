Location: Restaurant 
Time: Night
[MUSIC STARTS: STARLING]

  "When we arrive at the restaurant, Yamamoto has us seated in a secluded area."
  "Even with our disguises on, the feeling of anxiety still looms over me."
  "(Maybe I shouldn’t have jeopardized us just for food.)"
  "Yamamoto, being the ever perceptive man he was, speaks up."

[YAMAMOTO’S SPRITE APPEARS]
  yama [neutralsword] "Choose anything you’d like, Princess. It’s on me today."
  "I’m greeted by his kind smile, and I try to unwind."
  h "I’ll pick the most expensive thing then."
[smilesword] 
  "He chuckles heartily at my retort and slides over the menu."

[YAMAMOTO’S SPRITE DISAPPEARS]

  "(I suppose dinner with Yamamoto wouldn’t be so bad.)"

[YAMAMOTO’S SPRITE APPEARS]

  yama [neutralsword] "Should we get dessert?"
  "After enjoying each other’s company and great food, we’re both contentedly full."
  h "Why don’t we share one?"
  yama "I don’t think that’s appropriate for us, princess."

[MUSIC ENDS]

  "The flow of conversation ends to a screeching halt."
  h "Huh? What’s this appropriate nonsense?"
  yama "There’s only so much a bodyguard can do that feels respectful."
  h "But you’ve been on my bed before."
[blushsword] 
  "Yamamoto’s cheeks heat at the implications, though he tries to keep his expression stoic."
  yama "Princess…"
  "I realize the double meaning of my words and let out a high-pitched squeak."
  h "Like to comfort me.”
  yamamoto "Um…"
  h "N-N-N-Not together. Like--"
  [smilesword] 
  "Yamamoto laughs when my explanations worsen."

[MUSIC STARTS:NIGHT ON THE DOCKS]

  yama "Don’t worry, you’re absolutely right. Let’s share a piece of dessert."

[YAMAMOTO’S SPRITE DISAPPEARS]

  "Solaced by his attempt to gloss over my awkwardness, I return to scanning the menu before choosing the dessert I want."
  "(I wonder how much Yamamoto will take… I wonder how much Gokudera eats too.)"
  h "Hehe, but Gokudera would totally be against it though."
  "Yamamoto ignores my comment as he places the order."
  "When he returns his attention on me, his lips are pressed together in a hard line."
  h "Yamamoto?"

[YAMAMOTO’S SPRITE APPEARS]

  yama [distantsword] "You know, I have to wonder about something."
  h "Yeah?"
  "He seems too perplexed to continue, his finger sliding around the glass rim of his drink."
  h "Yamamoto?”"
  yama "Gokudera."
  h "What about Gokudera?"
  "I take a sip through my straw while watching Yamamoto’s expression twist with affliction."
  yama [neutralsword] "He's a great guy, right?"

      "I suppose?":
        h "Yeah, I suppose?"
        "I tilt my head in confusion, eyes focused on Yamamoto’s indescribable expression."
        h "Where are you going with this?"

      "He's annoying":
        "Just the sound of his name has my blood boiling."
        h "He's just an annoying person."
        yama "He’s just passionate."
        h "Yeah, to the point of annoyance…Anyways, what's the point?”

      "I prefer you":
        h "Honestly, I prefer you."
        [surprisesword] 
        "Yamamoto’s eyes widen, his follow up question lost on the panes of his lips."
        yama "In what way?"
        "A blush drowns my cheeks in rosy pigments, and I respond in a stuttering mess."
        h "L-L-Like as a person!! W-W-Why bring it up?"

  "Yamamoto stares at me fiercely, his eyes lost in my own."
  "(Uhhh… he’s acting weird.)"
  "I open my mouth to probe him for more, but he beats me to it."
  yama [distantsword] "I guess I just don't want you to like him more than me…"
  "His answer has me breathless, and it takes me a moment to compose myself enough to comprehend what he meant."
  h "Hey, you’ll always be my number one bodyguard."
  "He doesn’t falter and continues his unwavering stare on me."
  yama [neutralsword] "I didn’t mean it that way."
  h "In what way then?"
  "Yamamoto doesn’t answer yet, his focus solely on me."
  "The long pause impairs my reasoning, and my heart races."

[YAMAMOTO’S SPRITE DISAPPEARS]

  "(N-No way.)"
